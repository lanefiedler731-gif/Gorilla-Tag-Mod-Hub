        <h1>Passion for keeping Gorilla Tag mods alive and thriving.</h1>
        <p>
          Gorilla Tag evolves quickly and beloved mods often break along the way. I specialize in
          diagnosing those update pains, patching the code, and shipping clean, trustworthy builds so you
          can jump back into the trees with the experiences you love most.

          <h2 class="section-title">Why I Mod</h2>
          <p>
            Modding started as a personal challenge to fix what the latest patch broke. It quickly became
            a mission: keep the Gorilla Tag scene vibrant, respectful of the game, and welcoming for
            players who rely on custom tools. Each build I publish is thoroughly tested, versioned, and
            reviewed so you install with confidence.

              <h3>Rapid Patch Response</h3>
              <p>
                I track Gorilla Tag updates as soon as they drop, compare diffs, and isolate changes that
                impact public mods. This proactive workflow keeps downtime minimal for the community.

              <p>
                Every release includes changelogs, build metadata, and GitHub references so you can audit
                the update before installing. Transparency builds trust.

                Purpose-built for community hosts who want to reach Red Lobbies and play with others who
                are banned. It focuses on maintaining consistent access rather than promising to be
                undetected, so you always understand what to expect.

                Feedback is what keeps these mods sharp. I log update requests, test across multiple PC
